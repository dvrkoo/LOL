HTML/CSS FRONTEND INTERFACE (inspired by op.gg)

 - INPUT BOX
    -Hover animation or something to make it prettier
    -Make the text input and button even 
        -the general idea is to make it something like opgg search box where theyre merged
    -Search purpleish theme ideas (halfway throught)
        -as of now a purple hover animation has been made on the click button, time for the input text
    -Not foundamental more like future project:introduce the region select box
    
 - PAGE 
    -GOAL: the general goal is to have a section bar on the top like the opgg site I'll be introducing what I'm looking forward to do
    -SECTION BAR: here are the sections we want to put in our page
        -CHAMPIONS: we want a champions analytics page were the user can find useful info like pickrate,banrate and winrate for each role
        -LIVEGAME: THIS IS OPTIONAL the idea is to have a page like porofessor where you put the summoner name and it gives real time info
        -MMR checker: we want to use whatismymmr own api to check the player mmr more at https://dev.whatismymmr.com
